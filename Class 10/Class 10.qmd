## The PDB database

The main repository of bio molecular structure data is called the PDB found at: https://www.rcsb.org

Lets see what this database contains. Go to PDB> Analyze> PDB statistics> by experiment method and molecular type. 

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```
Due to the comma in these numbers, they are being read as characters insted of numeric values. 
I can fix this by replacing "," for nothing with the `sub()` function:
```{r}
x <- pdbstats$X.ray
sum( as.numeric(sub(",", "", x)))
```

OR I can use the **readr** package and the `read_csv()`

```{r}
library(readr)
```

```{r}
pdbstats <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```
I want to clean the column names so they are all lower case and don't have spaces in them.

```{r}
colnames(pdbstats)
```

```{r}
library(janitor)

df <- clean_names(pdbstats)
df
```
Total number of X-ray structures
```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)
```
Total number of structures 

```{r}
sum(df$total)
```

Percent of X-ray structures
```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)/sum(df$total) * 100
```
Percent of EM 

```{r}
sum(df$em)/sum(df$total) *100
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?


```{r}
sum(df$total[1:3])/sum(df$total) * 100
```


> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

There are currently 4,683 Structures


## 2. Using Mol*

You can use Mol* directly at the PDB website (as well as UniProt and elsewhere). However, for the latest and greatest version we will visit the Mol* homepage at: https://molstar.org/viewer/. We can input our own PDB files or just give it a PDB database accesion code (w letter PDB code)

## 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R 

We can use the **bio3d** package for structurual bioinformatics to read PDB data into R 

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1HSG")
pdb
```
> Q7. How many amino acid residues are ther ein this pdb object?

```{r}
length(pdbseq(pdb))
```

 >Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 
 
 HOH (127)
 
 > Q9.How many protein chains are in this structure?
 
 Two chains A and B 
 Looking at the pdb object in more detail 
 
```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```
```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```
 
 Lets try a new function not yer in the bio3d package. It requires the **r3dmol** package that we need to install with `install.packages("r3dmol")`. On top of this we need a package called "shiny" 
 
```{r}
library(r3dmol)
source("https://tinyurl.com/viewpdb")
#view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor ="pink") 
```

## 4.Prediciting functional dynamics
 
 We can use the `nma()` function in bio3d to predict the large-scale functional motions of biomolecules. 
 
```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```
 > Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN? 
 
 msa

> Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?: 

Bio3d-view

> Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket? 

TRUE
 
> Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence? 

214
 
```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```
 
 Write out a trajectory of the predicted molecular motion: 
 
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
mktrj
```
